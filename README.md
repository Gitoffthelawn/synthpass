# SynthPass
is a password synthesizer, which generates passwords on the fly rather than storing them like conventional password managers. it is conceived as an extension for Chrome or an add-on for Firefox. The only difference between the two is a few lines in the manifest.json file, and this is why there are two of them in the repo (should be renamed manifest.json before use).
SynthPass has its own Help page, and there is an information website at https://synthpass.weebly.com
